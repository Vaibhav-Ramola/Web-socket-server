# Web-socket-server
This repository contains a dummy web-socket server that can be run on a machine
I made this test server to send data to my application to test it's proper functionality
### Note
main.py contains the server code others are just for my reference
### Use
```
uvicorn app.main:app --host 0.0.0.0
```
to run the srever after all the packages from fast api are installed
